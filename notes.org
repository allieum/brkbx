#+title: Notes

* breakbox 1.0 functionality
** looping samples of various lengths
** internal clock & midi in
** keyboard controls
** oled screen
** dmx
** led dot lights
** fx
*** step repeat
*** timestretch
*** pitch mod
*** spice
*** gate
** banks

* brkbx MVP
**


* Todos
  ** init script
  *** call mpr to move library files onto the teensy board
  *** possibly mount wab files to the board, or just have them on the sd card
  ** initial project architecture
  *** map dependencies
  *** crude interfaces
  *** i/o, sample playing, synchronization, effects, midi
  ** major interaction points
  *** sample interacting with sequencer

* Hopes/Assumptions
  ** Previous bbox scheduler was complicated in order to account for delay
  ** Hope is that an embedded project will be able to have a much simpler scheduler
  ** How?
  *** Real-time audio device
  *** lightweight enough effects to not require a queue
  *** How many effects can we get away with?
  **** What is our processing power?
  **** What is the cost of each effect?
  **** What factors will introduce delay?
  **** How much delay can we tolerate?
  **** Probably need to do some research on this
  **** Wrong! We're gonna go for it



* Architecture stuff
  * Sample
  ** Array of samples
  
  * What needs to be stateful?
  ** effects don't really, can make them chainable
  ** midi probably does
