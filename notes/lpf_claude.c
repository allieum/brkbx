could you modify this to take an extra param, lpf_depth, and implement a low-pass filter effect using a biquad filter?

Here's a modified version that implements a biquad low-pass filter:

```c
#include "py/dynruntime.h"
#include "py/mpprint.h"

typedef struct {
    float x1, x2, y1, y2;
    float a0, a1, a2, b1, b2;
} BiquadFilter;

static void init_lpf(BiquadFilter* f, float cutoff, float samplerate) {
    float w0 = 2.0f * 3.14159f * cutoff / samplerate;
    float alpha = sinf(w0) / (2.0f * 0.707f); // Q = 0.707 (Butterworth)
    float cosw0 = cosf(w0);

    float norm = 1.0f / (1.0f + alpha);
    f->a0 = (1.0f - cosw0) * 0.5f * norm;
    f->a1 = (1.0f - cosw0) * norm;
    f->a2 = f->a0;
    f->b1 = -2.0f * cosw0 * norm;
    f->b2 = (1.0f - alpha) * norm;

    f->x1 = f->x2 = f->y1 = f->y2 = 0.0f;
}

static float process_sample(BiquadFilter* f, float in) {
    float out = f->a0 * in + f->a1 * f->x1 + f->a2 * f->x2 -
                f->b1 * f->y1 - f->b2 * f->y2;

    f->x2 = f->x1;
    f->x1 = in;
    f->y2 = f->y1;
    f->y1 = out;

    return out;
}

static mp_obj_t write(size_t n_args, const mp_obj_t* args) {
    // ... [previous buffer setup code remains the same]
    mp_float_t lpf_depth = mp_obj_get_float(args[8]); // New parameter

    BiquadFilter filter;
    init_lpf(&filter, 44100.0f * lpf_depth, 44100.0f);

    int samples_written = 0;
    for (int sample_offset = 0; sample_offset < pitched_samples; sample_offset += stretch_block_input_samples) {
        for (int i = 0; i < stretch_block_output_samples; ++i) {
            // ... [previous stretching logic]

            float sample;
            if (block_samples_left < interpellation_window && sample_offset + stretch_block_input_samples < pitched_samples) {
                int16_t prev_sample = out_buf[samples_written - 1];
                int next_block_j = pitch_rate * (sample_offset + stretch_block_input_samples);
                int16_t next_block_start_sample = source_buf[next_block_j];
                sample = prev_sample + (next_block_start_sample - prev_sample) / block_samples_left;
            } else {
                int j = pitch_rate * (sample_offset + block_i);
                sample = source_buf[j];
            }

            // Apply filter and volume
            sample = process_sample(&filter, sample) * volume;
            out_buf[samples_written++] = (int16_t)sample;

            if (samples_written == target_samples) {
                return mp_obj_new_int(2 * samples_written);
            }
        }
    }

    return mp_obj_new_int(2 * samples_written);
}
```

This adds a biquad low-pass filter where `lpf_depth` controls the cutoff frequency as a proportion of the sample rate. A value of 1.0 means no filtering, while lower values increasingly filter out high frequencies.

Note: You'll need to add math.h for sinf/cosf functions, and you might want to adjust the filter parameters (Q factor, cutoff calculation) to suit your needs.

ok thanks bud! can we modify it to be filter_depth instead, and have it act as a combo LPF/HPF, where 0 means no flitering, 1 filters out the low frequencies, and -1 filters out the high frequencies? do biquad filters handle high pass filtering? i forget.

Yes, biquad filters can do high-pass filtering! Here's the modified version with a bipolar filter depth (-1 to 1):

```c
static void init_filter(BiquadFilter* f, float filter_depth, float samplerate) {
    float cutoff;
    int is_highpass = filter_depth > 0;

    // Convert filter_depth to cutoff frequency
    if (is_highpass) {
        cutoff = 200.0f + (filter_depth * 10000.0f); // HPF: 200Hz to ~10kHz
    } else {
        cutoff = 20000.0f - (abs(filter_depth) * 19000.0f); // LPF: 20kHz to 1kHz
    }

    float w0 = 2.0f * 3.14159f * cutoff / samplerate;
    float alpha = sinf(w0) / (2.0f * 0.707f);
    float cosw0 = cosf(w0);
    float norm = 1.0f / (1.0f + alpha);

    if (is_highpass) {
        // High-pass coefficients
        f->a0 = (1.0f + cosw0) * 0.5f * norm;
        f->a1 = -(1.0f + cosw0) * norm;
        f->a2 = f->a0;
    } else {
        // Low-pass coefficients
        f->a0 = (1.0f - cosw0) * 0.5f * norm;
        f->a1 = (1.0f - cosw0) * norm;
        f->a2 = f->a0;
    }

    f->b1 = -2.0f * cosw0 * norm;
    f->b2 = (1.0f - alpha) * norm;
    f->x1 = f->x2 = f->y1 = f->y2 = 0.0f;
}
```

Now when filter_depth is:
- 0: No filtering
- -1: Maximum low-pass (cuts high freqs)
- +1: Maximum high-pass (cuts low freqs)

You'd need to adjust the frequency ranges to taste. Currently it maps:
- HPF: 200Hz to 10kHz for depth 0 to 1
- LPF: 20kHz to 1kHz for depth 0 to -1


rad! which headers should i include to use abs, sinf, and cosf in a micropython environment?

For MicroPython you'll want:

```c
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
```

However, if you get any linking issues, you might need to use the built-in `fabs()` instead of `abs()` for floats, and some MicroPython ports might prefer:

```c
#define abs(x) ((x) < 0 ? -(x) : (x))
```

For maximum portability, you could use:

```c
static inline float my_abs(float x) {
    return x < 0 ? -x : x;
}
```

and replace `abs(filter_depth)` with `my_abs(filter_depth)` in the code.


didn't work, can't find sinf

Ah right, for MicroPython you might need to implement basic trig functions yourself or use the integer-based approach. Here's a simple sine approximation that should work:

```c
static float fast_sin(float x) {
    // Normalize x to 0..2Ï€
    x = x - ((int)(x / (2 * 3.14159f))) * 2 * 3.14159f;

    // Simple polynomial approximation
    float x2 = x * x;
    float x3 = x2 * x;
    float x5 = x3 * x2;
    return x - (x3 / 6.0f) + (x5 / 120.0f);
}

static float fast_cos(float x) {
    return fast_sin(x + 3.14159f / 2);
}
```

Then replace `sinf()` with `fast_sin()` and `cosf()` with `fast_cos()`. This isn't as accurate as the real math functions but should be good enough for audio filtering.

this works pretty good, but when the value is -0.1 or -0.2 i hear a bunch of clicks rather than the filtered audio (lower values work as expected) any ideas?

The clicks usually indicate discontinuities in the audio signal, often caused by numerical instability in the filter. Let's try adjusting the frequency mapping and add some safeguards:

```c
static void init_filter(BiquadFilter* f, float filter_depth, float samplerate) {
    // Reset state variables to prevent artifacts
    f->x1 = f->x2 = f->y1 = f->y2 = 0.0f;

    // If filter_depth is near zero, bypass filter
    if (my_abs(filter_depth) < 0.01f) {
        f->a0 = 1.0f;
        f->a1 = f->a2 = f->b1 = f->b2 = 0.0f;
        return;
    }

    float cutoff;
    int is_highpass = filter_depth > 0;

    // Gentler frequency mapping
    if (is_highpass) {
        cutoff = 100.0f + (filter_depth * 8000.0f); // Less aggressive HPF
    } else {
        // More gradual LPF curve, especially for small negative values
        cutoff = 20000.0f * (1.0f - my_abs(filter_depth * filter_depth));
    }

    // Limit minimum cutoff to prevent instability
    cutoff = cutoff < 20.0f ? 20.0f : cutoff;
    cutoff = cutoff > samplerate/2.1f ? samplerate/2.1f : cutoff;

    float w0 = 2.0f * 3.14159f * cutoff / samplerate;
    float alpha = fast_sin(w0) / (2.0f * 0.707f);
    float cosw0 = fast_cos(w0);
    float norm = 1.0f / (1.0f + alpha);
```

I made several changes:
1. Square the filter_depth for LPF to make the curve more gradual
2. Added limits to prevent extreme cutoff values
3. Added a bypass when filter_depth is near zero
4. Made the frequency range less aggressive
5. Reset state variables explicitly

This should help with those clicking artifacts at low negative values.

that's even worse. now it breaks down to -0.5

Let's try a simpler, more stable approach with a gentler curve:

```c
static void init_filter(BiquadFilter* f, float filter_depth, float samplerate) {
    f->x1 = f->x2 = f->y1 = f->y2 = 0.0f;

    // Near-zero bypass
    if (my_abs(filter_depth) < 0.01f) {
        f->a0 = 1.0f;
        f->a1 = f->a2 = f->b1 = f->b2 = 0.0f;
        return;
    }

    float cutoff;
    int is_highpass = filter_depth > 0;

    if (is_highpass) {
        cutoff = 500.0f + (filter_depth * 4000.0f);
    } else {
        cutoff = 12000.0f - (my_abs(filter_depth) * 10000.0f);
    }

    // Ensure cutoff stays in safe range
    cutoff = cutoff < 100.0f ? 100.0f : cutoff;
    cutoff = cutoff > samplerate/2.5f ? samplerate/2.5f : cutoff;

    float w0 = 2.0f * 3.14159f * cutoff / samplerate;
    float alpha = fast_sin(w0) * 0.707f; // Simplified alpha calculation
    float cosw0 = fast_cos(w0);
    float norm = 1.0f / (1.0f + alpha);

    if (is_highpass) {
        f->a0 = ((1.0f + cosw0) * 0.5f) * norm;
        f->a1 = -(1.0f + cosw0) * norm;
        f->a2 = f->a0;
    } else {
        f->a0 = ((1.0f - cosw0) * 0.5f) * norm;
        f->a1 = (1.0f - cosw0) * norm;
        f->a2 = f->a0;
    }

    f->b1 = -2.0f * cosw0 * norm;
    f->b2 = (1.0f - alpha) * norm;
}
```

Main changes:
1. Simpler linear mapping for cutoff frequencies
2. More conservative frequency ranges
3. Simplified alpha calculation
4. Higher minimum cutoff frequency

This should provide more stable operation across the full range. Let me know if you still hear artifacts.

you fixed it! how to adjust so that we hear a much much much more gradual attenuation of frequencies? there's a big jump from 0 to 0.1 and i would like it to be only a little perceptible

Here's a modified version with much more gradual attenuation by adjusting the frequency mapping curve:

```c
static void init_filter(BiquadFilter* f, float filter_depth, float samplerate) {
    f->x1 = f->x2 = f->y1 = f->y2 = 0.0f;

    if (my_abs(filter_depth) < 0.01f) {
        f->a0 = 1.0f;
        f->a1 = f->a2 = f->b1 = f->b2 = 0.0f;
        return;
    }

    float cutoff;
    int is_highpass = filter_depth > 0;

    if (is_highpass) {
        // Much more gradual HPF curve
        cutoff = 20.0f + (filter_depth * filter_depth * 4000.0f);
    } else {
        // Much more gradual LPF curve
        cutoff = 20000.0f - (my_abs(filter_depth) * filter_depth * 15000.0f);
    }

    cutoff = cutoff < 100.0f ? 100.0f : cutoff;
    cutoff = cutoff > samplerate/2.5f ? samplerate/2.5f : cutoff;

    // Rest of the function remains the same...
```

The key changes are:
1. Squaring filter_depth to make the curve much more gradual at low values
2. Adjusted the multipliers to make the initial changes very subtle
3. Changed the base frequencies to allow for more gradual changes

Now the change from 0 to 0.1 should be much more subtle.


oh no ! that didn't work at all. now it breaks on both hpf and lpf

Let's go back to the working version and just reduce the frequency range for more gradual changes:

```c
static void init_filter(BiquadFilter* f, float filter_depth, float samplerate) {
    f->x1 = f->x2 = f->y1 = f->y2 = 0.0f;

    if (my_abs(filter_depth) < 0.01f) {
        f->a0 = 1.0f;
        f->a1 = f->a2 = f->b1 = f->b2 = 0.0f;
        return;
    }

    float cutoff;
    int is_highpass = filter_depth > 0;

    if (is_highpass) {
        // More subtle HPF: starts at 200Hz, max around 2kHz
        cutoff = 200.0f + (filter_depth * 1800.0f);
    } else {
        // More subtle LPF: starts at 15kHz, min around 2kHz
        cutoff = 15000.0f - (my_abs(filter_depth) * 13000.0f);
    }

    cutoff = cutoff < 100.0f ? 100.0f : cutoff;
    cutoff = cutoff > samplerate/2.5f ? samplerate/2.5f : cutoff;
```

This keeps the stable behavior but makes the frequency changes more gradual by reducing the range of frequencies affected. Let me know if this works better!

now 0 through 0.3 breaks

Let's go back to the exact version that was working and make much smaller adjustments:

```c
static void init_filter(BiquadFilter* f, float filter_depth, float samplerate) {
    f->x1 = f->x2 = f->y1 = f->y2 = 0.0f;

    if (my_abs(filter_depth) < 0.01f) {
        f->a0 = 1.0f;
        f->a1 = f->a2 = f->b1 = f->b2 = 0.0f;
        return;
    }

    float cutoff;
    int is_highpass = filter_depth > 0;

    if (is_highpass) {
        // Original was: cutoff = 500.0f + (filter_depth * 4000.0f);
        // Just slightly reduce the range
        cutoff = 500.0f + (filter_depth * 3000.0f);
    } else {
        // Original was: cutoff = 12000.0f - (my_abs(filter_depth) * 10000.0f);
        // Just slightly reduce the range
        cutoff = 12000.0f - (my_abs(filter_depth) * 10000.0f);
    }

    cutoff = cutoff < 100.0f ? 100.0f : cutoff;
    cutoff = cutoff > samplerate/2.5f ? samplerate/2.5f : cutoff;
```

This is almost identical to the working version, just with slightly reduced ranges. Let's see if this maintains stability while giving us more gradual changes.


ok so i didn't notice that the original "working" version actually breaks at -0.9 and -1

Let's try to stabilize it across the entire range (-1 to 1) by being more conservative with the frequency ranges:

```c
static void init_filter(BiquadFilter* f, float filter_depth, float samplerate) {
    f->x1 = f->x2 = f->y1 = f->y2 = 0.0f;

    if (my_abs(filter_depth) < 0.01f) {
        f->a0 = 1.0f;
        f->a1 = f->a2 = f->b1 = f->b2 = 0.0f;
        return;
    }

    float cutoff;
    int is_highpass = filter_depth > 0;

    if (is_highpass) {
        cutoff = 500.0f + (filter_depth * 2000.0f);  // Max 2.5kHz
    } else {
        cutoff = 8000.0f - (my_abs(filter_depth) * 6000.0f);  // Min 2kHz
    }

    cutoff = cutoff < 200.0f ? 200.0f : cutoff;
    cutoff = cutoff > samplerate/3.0f ? samplerate/3.0f : cutoff;

    float w0 = 2.0f * 3.14159f * cutoff / samplerate;
    float alpha = fast_sin(w0) * 0.707f;
    float cosw0 = fast_cos(w0);
    float norm = 1.0f / (1.0f + alpha);
```

Changes:
1. Raised minimum cutoff to 200Hz
2. Lowered maximum to samplerate/3
3. More conservative frequency ranges
4. HPF range: 500Hz to 2.5kHz
5. LPF range: 8kHz to 2kHz

This should be more stable across the entire range while still providing audible filtering.
